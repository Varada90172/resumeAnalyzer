Resume Analyzer

ðŸ“Œ Overview

The Resume Analyzer is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload resumes (PDF), automatically extracts key information, stores it in a database, and provides AI-powered feedback for improvement.

It has two main features:

1. Resume Analysis: Upload a resume â†’ Extract structured data â†’ Analyze with Gemini LLM â†’ Display rating, improvement areas, and upskilling suggestions.


2. Historical Viewer: View all previously uploaded resumes in a table â†’ Open details in a modal â†’ Reuse the same analysis view.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: PostgreSQL

PDF Parsing: pdf-parse

LLM Integration: Google Gemini API (@google/generative-ai)

Others: multer, dotenv, axios, cors

âš™ Architecture & Flow

1. User uploads a resume (PDF).


2. Backend extracts text using pdf-parse.


3. Text is passed to Gemini LLM with a prompt to generate structured JSON.


4. Data is stored in PostgreSQL (JSONB columns for flexible nested data).


5. Frontend displays the results in a structured UI.


6. Past resumes can be fetched and viewed in a history tab.

ðŸ—„ Database Design

A single table resumes stores:

Basic info (name, email, phone, links)

Summary, skills, work experience, education, projects, certifications

AI feedback (resume rating, improvement areas, upskill suggestions)
